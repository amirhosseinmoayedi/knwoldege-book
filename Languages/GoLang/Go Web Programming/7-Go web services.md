# **web services**
<font color="#c3d69b">Web services</font>, at a basic level, are software <font color="#c3d69b">programs that interact with other software programs</font>.

- <font color="#92cddc">SOAP-based</font> web services are mostly being used in **enterprise systems**
- <font color="#fac08f">REST-based</font> web services are more popular in publicly available web services.[[REST API]]
## <font color="#92cddc">SOAP</font>
**SOAP-based** services are *robust*, are explicitly described using *WSDL*
(Web Service Definition Language), and have built-in **error handling**.

SOAP is known to be ***cumbersome and unnecessarily complex***.
The SOAP [[XML]] messages can grow to be verbose and difficult to troubleshoot, and you may often need other tools to manage them.

SOAP is usable across different networking protocols and is independent of programming models.

Every operation and input or output of the service is clearly defined in the **WSDL**. The WSDL is the *contract* between the client and theserver, defining what the service provides and how it’s provided.

Content-Type is set to `application/soap+xml`
```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<soap:Envelope xmlns:soap="http://www.w3.org/2001/12/soap-envelope"
 soap:encodingStyle="http://www.w3.org/2001/12/soap encoding">
    <soap:Body xmlns:m="http://www.example.org/stock">
        <m:GetCommentResponse>
            <m:Text>Hello World!</m:Text>
        </m:GetCommentResponse>
    </soap:Body>
</soap:Envelope>
```

SOAP mostly uses the HTTP **POST** method, although SOAP 1.2 allows HTTP **GET** as well.

In practice, SOAP request messages are often **generated** by a SOAP client that’s generated from the WSDL. Similarly, SOAP response messages are often generated by a SOAP server that’s also generated from the WSDL.

As a result, as long as the WSDL is well defined, the SOAP client is usually **robust**. The drawback is that each time we change the service, even for a small matter like changing the type of the return value, the client **needs to be regenerated**.

### <font color="#d99694">WSDL</font>
**WSDL**, while providing a solid contract between the client and server, can become burdensome because every change in the web service requires the WSDL and **therefore the SOAP clients to be changed**. **This often results in version lock-in as the developers of the web service are wary of making even the smallest changes.**

## [[REST API]]
You can return the same SOAP response earlier and it can still be considered a RESTful response because **REST is concerned only about the design** of the API and not the message that’s sent.
