- <font color="#fac08f">URI</font>: A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a <u>string of characters used to identify or name a resource on the internet</u>. A URI can be used to identify any kind of resource, including web pages, images, videos, or other types of files. **URIs can be either a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) or a Uniform Resource Name (URN)** or both.
    
- <font color="#fac08f">URL</font>: A Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is a type of URI that <u>provides the location of a resource on the web</u>. A URL typically consists of several parts, including a **protocol** (e.g. http or https), a **domain name**, and **a path** to a specific resource. For example, the URL "[https://www.example.com/index.html](https://www.example.com/index.html)" identifies the web page "index.html" on the domain "[www.example.com](http://www.example.com/)" using the HTTPS protocol.
    
- <font color="#fac08f">URN</font>: A Uniform Resource Name (URN) is another type of URI that provides a <u>persistent name for a resource on the web</u>. Unlike a URL, a URN does not provide the location of the resource, but rather just its name. URNs can be used to identify resources even if they have been moved or their location has changed.
