# <font color="#953734">Service Mesh</font>
A service mesh is a <u>dedicated infrastructure layer for managing, controlling, and monitoring service-to-service communication within a microservice architecture</u>.

### It is usally has two part:
-   **<font color="#fac08f">Data plane</font>**: The data plane is<font color="#fac08f"> responsible for managing and routing network traffic between services</font>. It usually consists of lightweight proxies (e.g., Envoy, Linkerd) that are deployed alongside each service instance.
-   **<font color="#548dd4">Control plane</font>**: The control plane is <font color="#548dd4">responsible for managing and configuring the data plane proxies</font>. It provides a central point for enforcing policies, collecting metrics, and deploying configurations. Examples of control plane implementations include Istio, Linkerd, and Consul Connect.

## **features of a service mesh**:
 -  <font color="#ffff00">Traffic management</font>: Service mesh provides fine-grained control over traffic routing, **load balancing**, and **failover** between services.
 -   <font color="#92d050">Observability</font>: Service mesh offers deep insights into service performance, dependencies, and communication patterns by collecting and analyzing metrics, logs, and traces.
 -   <font color="#ffc000">Security</font>: Service mesh enforces secure communication between services using mutual TLS (mTLS) and implements <u>access control policies</u>.
 -   <font color="#0070c0">Resiliency</font>: Service mesh helps improve the resiliency of your system by implementing retries, timeouts, and [[Circuit Breaker]] for better fault tolerance.

### **Integration with <font color="#92cddc">container platforms</font>**: 
Service mesh solutions can be easily integrated with popular container orchestration platforms like [[Kubernetes]] or Docker Swarm, providing a seamless experience for managing microservices.
